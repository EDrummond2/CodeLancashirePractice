        <blockquote>
            Within a fortnight, I organised a 7000-letter mail-shot to the Human Resources contacts at large
            employers based in the UK, asking them to put forward prosepctive students for a prestigious course at
            Lancaster University Management School. Managing the project involved sourcing and managing additional
            staff, ordering stationary, and organising contact lists, print runs and setting up the task chain at each
            session.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            Doing a research degree using a new programming language offered opportunities and motivation to hit the
            ground running. Once lockdowns meant also unexpectedly homeschooling children, I had the chance to show my
            skills in prioritisation and independent research. Continuing to work efficiently and successfully despite
            unsupervised for months at a time, during which I had no contact as supervisors were dealing with their own
            pandemic-related issues. I managed to not only continue to effectively solve problems, but also develop all the project's validation methods and data visualisation.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            During my time working at the University of Cambridge, I acted as the bridge between the fly lab and the wet
            lab, leading to a role in the project's steering committee. Both groups had their own signficant expertise
            but needed to understand the work and limitations of the other team. I created booklets on PCR for the fly
            team so they could understand the processes in the wet lab, and helped negotiate timetabling issues to
            enable the teams' work run smoothly.

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <a name="Skills"></a>
        <ul id="skill_list">
            <li> <strong>Communication Skills</strong> - I have organised large charity events, and brokered
                data-sharing
                agreements with challenging limitations. I have given talks to varied audiences on my methods and
                projects.
                During my time as a lecture notetaker, I adapted my output to the needs of the student, including
                recording
                physics and maths course notes in accessible LATEX output for a visually-impaired student.</li>
            <li><strong>Leadership Skills</strong> - I have lead teams of volunteers to provide public events, and
                organised
                groups to perform high-throughput tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Mediation Skills</strong> - I have found common aims between disparate groups of individuals;
                researchers wanting research data and NHS data protectors.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Service Skills</strong> - I have provided a good, unbiased service at polling stations,
                aiding all voted to use their vote.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytical/Logical Skills</strong> - I have analysed and improved systems from lab protocols to
                vote
                recording.</li>
            <li><strong>Critical Thinking Skills</strong> - I created fair methods of validating improvements to the
                current
                route to genetic imputation, ensuring neither method was unduly advantaged.</li>
            <li><strong>Problem-solving Skills</strong> - I regularly met challenges to data sources, cleaning and
                analysis
                and method validation. I researched and then created novel routes to acomplish these things.</li>
            <li><strong>Decision-making Skills</strong> - I have performed well in time-critical situations, building
                systems to aid action, and taken advice or used current knowledge to make large-scale decisions when
                time-allowed.</li>
            <li><strong>Planning Skills</strong> - I have designed and perfromed large scale lab screens of fruit-flies,
                which involved scaling up stock lines in good time for future crosses but not before to avoid wasting
                resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Organisational Skills</strong> - I have planned large public events, using teams of volunteers
                where
                volunteering cannot be a priority above childcare. I have planned intricate proceedures to interlace two
                or
                three protocol where gaps or waiting times can be used effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Writing Skills</strong> - I have written four peer-reviewed, academic papers and have a
                fifth in the pipeline. My thesis communicated a new method of information interpolation and novel
                validation
                methods in over 40,000 words.</li>
            <li><strong>Research Skills</strong> - I had to thoroughly research, understand and communicate the current
                knowledge around the topic of my masters, before exploring methods to extend the field myself. I had to
                find
                routes to solve problems and research their efficacy before implementation.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Computing Skills</strong> - I taught myself the R programming language solving the
                varied
                and inevitable problems in a large research project, with an emphasis on string manipulation,
                regular-expression searches and data visualisation. Some tasks were also performed using the Python
                language, for computing speed or as a double-checking exercise, which I also learned during the project.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Technological Skills</strong> I have worked with a many novel and expensive technologies, such
                as
                DNA sequencers, programmable PCR machines and a prototype laser-light fly embryo-sorter machine. I used
                the
                machines, and orgainsed their upkeep, through daily maintainance and servicing.</li>
            <li><strong>Perceptual Skills</strong> I have been able to grasp the concepts of genetics, evolution and
                genomic
                data imputation well. I have had to understand and implement statistical methods and routes to
                processing
                large bodies of data accurately.</li>
            <li><strong>Adaptibility Skills</strong> - Much of a day in the lab can be predictable, but new information
                must
                be assimlated quickly, including all the implications of that information. I have dealt with; large
                scale
                work, with great fluctuations in work load, laser-light failures, contaminated stocks or reagents, and
                changing time-frames or staffing levels. Good adaptibility involves a rapid assessment of how this new
                information should inform future actions, something I have faced many times and coped with well. </li>
